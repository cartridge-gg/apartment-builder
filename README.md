Apartment Builder is a proof of concept for shareable assets and apartments across games.

The idea behind this project is an apartment you can create and modify, which is stored and validated on-chain, but which would also be potentially usable in other games and starknet platforms, while providing an interface for those said platforms to integrate their own assets.
